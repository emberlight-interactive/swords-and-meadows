Two Mages traveling, exciting bubbling dora music plays
Magic spell shoots from trees, music stops "What the-?", ambush proceeds, players get wiped out 
"Yeah I think we're going to need some help"
Pull up steam chat and writes "Bruh can you help us?"

Adventurous music plays

Player pops into a bustling village. Starts moving amongst villagers.
"Welcome, to the land of swords and meadows; online"

Traverse the landscape, group members collecting resources, you travel towards villagers
"It's not just you here, all players co exist in the same world"

Cam fixed on deserted villagers, player enters frame, surprised indicator
"Every action you take, affects Everyone"

Player places base post, timelapse to big village, zoom out

Player interacts with chest, discovers weapon parts, spell books, another player emerges contesting resources
"Not all players will be so welcoming"

Battle between character and enemy
